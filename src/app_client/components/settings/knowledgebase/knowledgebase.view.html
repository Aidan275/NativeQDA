			<h1 style='color:#009ac9;'>Knowledgebase</h1>
			<h3>Using the "Find" button above you can navigate through the conent in the knowledgebase regarding how things work, where to find things and why things are the way they are.</h3>
		
		</div>
		<div ng-show="vm.terminology" class="pageItem">
			<h2 style='color:#009ac9;'>Terminology</h2>
			<h3 style='color:#009ac9;'>"File"</h3>
			<p>A file within the NativeQDA system is conistant with what you would normally conisder a file in other system. These are individual</p>
			<p>files which you upload through the file upload page and can be in a variety of types such as pdf, docx, txt, mp3 ,jpg  e.t.c. These </p>
			<p>files are used to create datasets and are displayed on the map.</p>
			<h3 style='color:#009ac9;'>"Analysis"</h3>
			<p >An analysis is conducted on datasets to generate visualisations and can be created in the Analysis page. An analysis is this process</p>
			<p>of extracting relationships between word frequency, entites, concepts, themes e.t.c. After an analysis has been created from a datsets</p>
			<p>all the available visualisations which are combatable with that dataset will automatically be avaialable int eh visualisations page for viewing</p>
			<h3 style='color:#009ac9;'>"Visualisation"</h3>
			<p>A visualisation occurs as a result of an analysis and comes in forms of any charts, graphs, diagrams or visual representation of the information</p>
			<p> which was extracted and created during the analysis process. These visualisations can be saved for use in other research.</p>
		</div>
		<div ng-show="vm.uploading" class="pageItem">
			<h2 id="U" style='color:#009ac9;'>Uploading Files</h2>
			<p>Files can be added to the system by clicking the files option in the top navigation bar. Once on the files page users will be presented</p>
			<p>with a table displaying all files which are currently on the system, just above this table on the right hand side there are two buttons</p>
			<p>"Upload File" and "New Folder". Clicking on the upload file option will open up a file browser which enables files to be dragged or selected.</p>
			<p>The New Folder option will create a folder within the table on the files page which works as a normal folder on a computer, files can be saved</p>
			<p>within these folders and can even contain subfolders. These folders can be navigated by clicking the folder itself or using the directory</p>
			<p>locted on the top left of the files table.</p>
		</div>
		<div ng-show="vm.analysis" class="pageItem">
			<h2 id="A" style='color:#009ac9;'>Creating an Analysis</h2>
			<p>A new analysis can be created by clicking on the Analysis option in the top navigation bar. Initially this page appears similar to the files</p>
			<p>page, a table is shown which contains all previous analysis' which have been performed. A "New Analysis" button is located on the top right</p>
			<p>side of this table, which opens a popup window where a name and description can be given to a new analysis. Also within this popup is a table</p>
			<p>containing all files uploaded to the system. clicking on the checkbox next to the file name will include this file in the new analysis. Depending</p>
			<p> on the types of files selected some forms of analysis may not be avaiable, however all forms of analysis which are possible with the selected</p>
			<p>files will be generated upon clicking the analyze button in the popup window.</p>
		</div>
		<div ng-show="vm.visualisations" class="pageItem">
			<h2 id="V" style='color:#009ac9;'>Viewing Visualisations</h2>
			<p>Visualisations can be found in the same place as an analysis as seen in "Creating an Analysis", by clicking on the Analysis option in the top</p>
			<p>navigation bar. Within this analysis page every analysis which has been created is presented within a table, the column of this table on the far right</p>
			<p>side is titled "Command". This column enables an analysis to be viewed by clicking the "view" option, opening the visualisation page for that</p>
			<p>analysis. Within this visualisation page there is a navigation bar on the left of the entire page which displays the various categories of</p>
			<p>visualisations which can be selected. Selecting a category such as "Concepts" will present all visualisations relevant to concepts to appear on</p>
			<p>the page. By hovering the mouse over these visualisations a descriptive title will appear and clicking on the visualisation will open it for viewing.</p>
		</div>
		<div ng-show="vm.map" class="pageItem">
			<h2 id="M" style='color:#009ac9;'>The Map</h2>
			<p>Selecting the Map option in the top navigation bar will display the map page which is a large geographical map like Google Maps with a few differences.</p>
			<br />
			<p>All files within the system will appear on this map where they have been geo-tagged. Depending on the file type a different icon will represent the</p>
			<p>file. Clicking on the file icon on the map will display a small window with options and a description. These options enable the file to be viewed, edited,</p>
			<p> deleted and a "Dependencies" option. The "Dependencies" option when clicked on allows for another file to be selected which will create a line between </p>
			<p>the two. These lines simply represent a connection between the files, they are not used for analysis or any other part of the system except the map.</p>
			<p>If multiple files are uploaded which cover a similar topic or contain data from similar areas you may like to create dependencies to represent</p>
			<p>that these files relate to each other.</p>
			<p>Your user icon will also be displyed on a pin which is set on your current location and an options menu bar is located on the left of the page. Clicking</p>
			<p>on this bar will cause it to expand displaying settings, filters and a search option. A filter called "Show Dependencies" exists which when clicked</p>
			<p>displays all connections between files.</p>
